# specimen-tools

`specimen-tools` contains code related to the iOS application 
[Specimen](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/specimen-a-game-about-color/).
This can be used to: build a database of Specimen data, query it, and
includes additional utilities for simple things like plotting common
color-related data.

In order to avoid additional spamming of the original Specimen authors, 
for access to the underlying Specimen data, please reach out to 
Jose Cambronero (jcamsan@mit.edu). Access to the data is decided on a
case-by-case basis and there is no guarantee of approval. Applications
related to research or open-source experimentation are encouraged.

## Acknowledgements
We thank Erica Gorochow, Salvatore Randazzo, and Charlie Whitney
for providing access to the Specimen dataset and for building
the Specimen application.
